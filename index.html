        <p class="lead"> An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform
            calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

            The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became
            available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel
            for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry
            (oil and gas).

            Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models
            with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits
            reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic
            calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

            Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as
            dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type
            devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

            In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example,
            there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators
            even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on
            the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but
            scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

            In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to
            compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.[1] <blockquote> <i
